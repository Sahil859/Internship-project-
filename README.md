# Email Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies emails or messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. The model is built using Python and common data science libraries in Google Colab.

---

## Project Overview

Spam detection is a common classification problem in Machine Learning.
In this project, a text classification model is trained to identify whether a message is spam or legitimate.

The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a Machine Learning regression model that predicts house prices based on various housing features. The project was developed using Python in Google Colab.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

This project is part of my Machine Learning practice and portfolio.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Google Colab

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **Boston House Price dataset**, which contains housing-related features such as:

* Crime rate
* Number of rooms
* Property tax rate
* Accessibility to highways
* etc.

Target variable:

* House Price
