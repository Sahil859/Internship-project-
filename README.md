# Email Spam Classifier using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning model that classifies emails or messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)**. The model is built using Python and common data science libraries in Google Colab.

---

## Project Overview

Spam detection is a common classification problem in Machine Learning.
In this project, a text classification model is trained to identify whether a message is spam or legitimate.

The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
